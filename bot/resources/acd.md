**Academic Dishonesty**

We do not encourage academic dishonesty at all. This includes:

- Help on any form of graded assessment
- Paid help on any work

If you are caught whilst purposefully committing academic dishonesty, you will first be given a verbal warning.
Any repeated offences warrant more severe actions
